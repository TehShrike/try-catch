- my parents (They had me and thought "hey, let's try to raise a reasonable human", and they gave it a pretty good go all things considered)
- butts (mine is awesome, my wifes is exciting.  Touch a butt today!)
- the letter C (computers, code, Jethro's favorite letter)
- vaudville: your leading provider of comedy.  Try a pratfall today
- Ben Burnes: https://abstractionmusic.bandcamp.com/album/do-this-justice
	- https://abstractionmusic.bandcamp.com/album/covered-in-cats - an album that slowly transitions from piano to electronic, while also somehow being a concept album about the act of creation

- me
